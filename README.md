# CycleGAN and pix2pix in PyTorch - Refactored

This is a refactored version of the PyTorch implementation of CycleGAN and pix2pix, with added support for:
- Optuna hyperparameter tuning
- Data preprocessing caching
- Improved directory structure
- Central entry point for all operations

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/username/refactored-CycleGAN-and-pix2pix
cd refactored-CycleGAN-and-pix2pix

Install dependencies:

bashpip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Preprocessing Data
bashpython main.py preprocess --config config/train_config.json --dataroot ./datasets/facades
Training
bashpython main.py train --config config/train_config.json --name facades_pix2pix --model pix2pix --direction BtoA
Testing
bashpython main.py test --config config/train_config.json --name facades_pix2pix --model pix2pix --direction BtoA
Hyperparameter Tuning
bashpython main.py tune --config config/train_config.json --n_trials 50 --study_name "my_tuning_study"
Configuration
Configuration files are stored in the config/ directory:

base_config.json: Base configuration settings
train_config.json: Training-specific settings
hyperparameter_space.json: Defines ranges for Optuna hyperparameter tuning

Key Hyperparameters

lr: Learning rate
beta1: Beta1 parameter for Adam optimizer
lambda_L1: Weight for L1 loss (pix2pix)
lambda_A/lambda_B: Weights for cycle consistency loss (CycleGAN)
netG: Generator architecture (resnet_9blocks, resnet_6blocks, unet_256, unet_128)
netD: Discriminator architecture (basic, n_layers, pixel)
n_layers_D: Number of layers for n_layers discriminator
norm: Normalization type (batch, instance, none)
gan_mode: GAN loss type (vanilla, lsgan, wgangp)

Caching
The refactored codebase includes caching for preprocessed data to speed up multiple training runs.

Use --use_cache to enable caching
Use --clear_cache to clear the cache before running

Weights & Biases Integration
The code integrates with Weights & Biases for experiment tracking:

Use --use_wandb to enable W&B logging
Set --wandb_project_name to specify the project name

Optuna Integration
Hyperparameter tuning is done using Optuna:

Create a study with tune operation
Customize the parameter search space in config/hyperparameter_space.json
Results are stored in SQLite database and can be analyzed with Optuna Dashboard


## 12. Testing

To ensure all functionality works as expected, I will test:

1. Basic functionality:
   - Preprocessing
   - Training
   - Testing
   - Hyperparameter tuning

2. Caching:
   - Verify cached data is correctly loaded
   - Verify cache clearing works

3. Wandb integration:
   - Verify metrics are logged correctly

4. Optuna integration:
   - Verify trials are running properly
   - Verify best parameters are saved correctly

## 13. Additional Considerations

### 13.1 Backward Compatibility
Maintain backward compatibility with the original code structure where possible to facilitate migration.

### 13.2 Error Handling
Implement comprehensive error handling throughout the codebase to provide helpful error messages.

### 13.3 Documentation
Add detailed docstrings and comments to all functions and classes.

### 13.4 Performance Optimization
Look for opportunities to optimize performance, especially in data loading and preprocessing.

### 13.5 Memory Management
Implement proper memory management practices, especially for large datasets.

### 13.6 Multi-GPU Support
Ensure multi-GPU support is maintained and properly documented.

### 13.7 CI/CD
Set up basic CI/CD for automated testing of the refactored codebase.
</refactoring_plan>

This comprehensive refactoring plan maintains the core functionality of the CycleGAN and pix2pix implementations while significantly improving the architecture, adding hyperparameter tuning with Optuna, implementing proper caching mechanisms, and creating a centralized entry point for all operations.

The plan includes detailed implementations of key files including the preprocessing module, caching system, hyperparameter tuning framework, and a unified main interface. It also updates the configuration files and documentation to make the system more accessible and maintainable.

By following this plan, you'll transform the repository into a more modern, maintainable, and powerful tool for image-to-image translation research while preserving compatibility with existing models and datasets.
